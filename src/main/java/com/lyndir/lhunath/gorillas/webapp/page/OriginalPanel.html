                <p>The original <code>GORILLA.BAS</code> was a <abbr>DOS</abbr> game written in <abbr>QBASIC</abbr>.
                   The following is a pixel-perfect copy of the old game in <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">Flash</a>.
                </p>

                <p><i>Your mission</i> is to hit your opponent with the exploding banana by varying the angle and power
                                       of your throw,
                                       taking into account wind speed, gravity, and the city skyline.</p>

                <p>The wind speed is shown by a directional arrow at the bottom of the playing field;
                   its length is relative to its strength.</p>

                <p>Just like <a class="border" href="?about">Gorillas</a> and the original <code>GORILLA.BAS</code>,
                   this Flash port is entirely open source.<br />
                   So go <a href="http://rickyroad.com/games/gorillas">check out the author</a>!</p>
