                    by <a class="border" href="http://rickyroad.com/games/gorillas"
                            onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview(this.href.replace(/^[a-z]+:\/\//i, '/external/'));">Ricky Road</a></p>
                <p><i>Your mission</i> is to hit your opponent with the exploding banana by varying the angle and power of your throw,
                taking into account wind speed, gravity, and the city skyline.</p>

                <p>The wind speed is shown by a directional arrow at the bottom of the playing field, its length relative to its strength.</p>

                <p>This is an identical port of GORILLA.BAS to Flash by
                    <a class="border" href="http://rickyroad.com/games/gorillas"
                        onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview(this.href.replace(/^[a-z]+:\/\//i, '/external/'));">Ricky Road</a>.
                    And above all, just like <a class="border" href="?about">Gorillas</a> and the original GORILLA.BAS, it's entirely open source.<br />
                    So go check it out!
